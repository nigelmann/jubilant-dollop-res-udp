# Teaching-HEIGVD-API-2022-Labo-Orchestra

## Admin

- **You can work in groups of 2 students**.
- It is up to you if you want to fork this repo, or if you prefer to work in a private repo. However, you have to **use exactly the same directory structure for the validation procedure to work**.
- We expect that you will have more issues and questions than with other labs (because we have a left some questions open on purpose). Please ask your questions on Teams, so that everyone in the class can benefit from the discussion.
- ⚠️ You will have to send your GitHub URL, answer the questions and send the output log of the `validate.sh` script, which prove that your project is working [in this Google Form](https://forms.gle/6SM7cu4cYhNsRvqX8).

## Objectives

This lab has 4 objectives:

- The first objective is to **design and implement a simple application protocol on top of UDP**. It will be very similar to the protocol presented during the lecture (where thermometers were publishing temperature events in a multicast group and where a station was listening for these events).

- The second objective is to get familiar with several tools from **the JavaScript ecosystem**. You will implement two simple **Node.js** applications. You will also have to search for and use a couple of **npm modules** (i.e. third-party libraries).

- The third objective is to continue practicing with **Docker**. You will have to create 2 Docker images (they will be very similar to the images presented in class). You will then have to run multiple containers based on these images.

- Last but not least, the fourth objective is to **work with a bit less upfront guidance**, as compared with previous labs. This time, we do not provide a complete webcast to get you started, because we want you to search for information (this is a very important skill that we will increasingly train). Don't worry, we have prepared a fairly detailed list of tasks that will put you on the right track. If you feel a bit overwhelmed at the beginning, make sure to read this document carefully and to find answers to the questions asked in the tables. You will see that the whole thing will become more and more approachable.

## Requirements

In this lab, you will **write 2 small NodeJS applications** and **package them in Docker images**:

- the first app, **Musician**, simulates someone who plays an instrument in an orchestra. When the app is started, it is assigned an instrument (piano, flute, etc.). As long as it is running, every second it will emit a sound (well... simulate the emission of a sound: we are talking about a communication protocol). Of course, the sound depends on the instrument.

- the second app, **Auditor**, simulates someone who listens to the orchestra. This application has two responsibilities. Firstly, it must listen to Musicians and keep track of **active** musicians. A musician is active if it has played a sound during the last 5 seconds. Secondly, it must make this information available to you. Concretely, this means that it should implement a very simple TCP-based protocol.

### Instruments and sounds

The following table gives you the mapping between instruments and sounds. Please **use exactly the same string values** in your code, so that validation procedures can work.

| Instrument | Sound       |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `piano`    | `ti-ta-ti`  |
| `trumpet`  | `pouet`     |
| `flute`    | `trulu`     |
| `violin`   | `gzi-gzi`   |
| `drum`     | `boum-boum` |

### TCP-based protocol to be implemented by the Auditor application

- The auditor should include a TCP server and accept connection requests on port 2205.
- After accepting a connection request, the auditor must send a JSON payload containing the list of <u>active</u> musicians, with the following format (it can be a single line, without indentation):

```
[
  {
  	"uuid" : "aa7d8cb3-a15f-4f06-a0eb-b8feb6244a60",
  	"instrument" : "piano",
  	"activeSince" : "2016-04-27T05:20:50.731Z"
  },
  {
  	"uuid" : "06dbcbeb-c4c8-49ed-ac2a-cd8716cbf2d3",
  	"instrument" : "flute",
  	"activeSince" : "2016-04-27T05:39:03.211Z"
  }
]
```

### What you should be able to do at the end of the lab

You should be able to start an **Auditor** container with the following command:

```
$ docker run -d -p 2205:2205 res/auditor
```

You should be able to connect to your **Auditor** container over TCP and see that there is no active musician.

```
$ telnet IP_ADDRESS_THAT_DEPENDS_ON_YOUR_SETUP 2205
[]
```

You should then be able to start a first **Musician** container with the following command:

```
$ docker run -d res/musician piano
```

After this, you should be able to verify two points. Firstly, if you connect to the TCP interface of your **Auditor** container, you should see that there is now one active musician (you should receive a JSON array with a single element). Secondly, you should be able to use `tcpdump` to monitor the UDP datagrams generated by the **Musician** container.

You should then be able to kill the **Musician** container, wait 5 seconds and connect to the TCP interface of the **Auditor** container. You should see that there is now no active musician (empty array).

You should then be able to start several **Musician** containers with the following commands:

```
$ docker run -d res/musician piano
$ docker run -d res/musician flute
$ docker run -d res/musician flute
$ docker run -d res/musician drum
```

When you connect to the TCP interface of the **Auditor**, you should receive an array of musicians that corresponds to your commands. You should also use `tcpdump` to monitor the UDP trafic in your system.

| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Question | In a JavaScript program, if we have an object, how can we **serialize it in JSON**? |
|          | With the `JSON.stringify` function this converts an object to a json formated string                                                       |
| Question | What is **npm**?                                                                    |
|          | Npm is the Node Package Manager, it helps us use js libraries written by other developpers                                                       |
| Question | What is the `npm install` command?                                                  |
|          | It installs the dependencies specifies in the `package-json.lock` if it exista otherwise it looks into the `package.json` file, The --save flag is set by default but we can add the --no-save to avoid updating the dependencies                                                       |

| Question | In Node.js, how can we execute a function on a **periodic** basis?                  |
|          | With the `setInterval` function that take a function as first argument and then an interval in milliseconds                                                       |
| Question | In Node.js, how can we **emit UDP datagrams**?                                      |
|          | With the dgram library that is a core node module.                                                      |
| Question | In Node.js, how can we **access the command line arguments**?                       |
|          | Through `process.argv`                                                      |

## Task 3: package the "musician" app in a Docker image

| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Question | With Node.js, how can we listen for UDP datagrams in a multicast group?                            |
|          | By using the `dgram` library and using the bing function on the socket and the event "message"                                                                     |
| Question | How can we use the `Map` built-in object introduced in ECMAScript 6 to implement a **dictionary**? |
|          | By creating a `new Map()` and passing an array of arrays as paramter the first element will be the key and the second the value                                                                      |
| Question | How can we use the `Day.js` npm module to help us with **date manipulations** and formatting?      |
|          | For this we did not need it default dates in Js work fine                                                                      |

| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Question | How do we validate that the whole system works, once we have built our Docker image? |
|          | we run the `validate.sh` script, otherwise we can test with telnet to check what instruments are playing and spinning up containers manually and then killing them and checking everything is up to date using telnet                                                       |

## Constraints

Please be careful to adhere to the specifications in this document, and in particular

- the Docker image names
- the names of instruments and their sounds
- the TCP PORT number

Also, we have prepared two directories, where you should place your two `Dockerfile` with their dependent files.

### Validation

Have a look at the `validate.sh` script located in the top-level directory. This script automates part of the validation process for your implementation (it will gradually be expanded with additional operations and assertions). As soon as you start creating your Docker images (i.e. creating your Dockerfiles), you should **try to run it** to see if your implementation is correct. When you submit your project in the [Google Form](https://forms.gle/6SM7cu4cYhNsRvqX8), the script will be used for grading, together with other criteria.
